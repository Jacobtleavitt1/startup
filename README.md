# Startup
This is a startup idea by Jacobtleavitt1 proctected by license. See "LICENSE" for more information.

## Elevator Pitch
Did you know that over 98% of employees want to work from home but only 13% actually do. This is because employers don't trust that wfh employees will acomplish the same as traditional employees and employees don't like software that monitors their home computer. This startup will create a program that allows employees to self-report what they will acomplish each day so employers can see what they are working on and verify their progress without using intrusive software.

## Key Features
- User can log in and log out.
- User can add tasks to the calendar which will be saved in the database.
- User can see messages from employeer regarding work.
- User can download tasks to a web calendar for ease of use.

The key features of the site will allow employees and employers to create a type of informal "contract" each day of tasks that need to be completed. This will allow employees to feel the freedom of working from home while providing the employer with reasonable assurance of the employee's work.
