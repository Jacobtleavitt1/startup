# Startup
This is a startup idea by Jacobtleavitt1 proctected by license. See "LICENSE" for more information.

## Elevator Pitch
Did you know that over 98% of employees want to work from home but only 13% actually do. This is because employers don't trust that wfh employees will acomplish the same as traditional employees and employees don't like software that monitors their home computer. This startup will create a program that allows employees to self-report what they will acomplish each day so employers can see what they are working on and verify their progress without using intrusive software.

## Key Features
- User can log in and log out.
- User can add tasks to the calendar which will be saved in the database.
- User can see messages from employeer regarding work.
- User can download tasks to a web calendar for ease of use.

> 98% of employees want to work from home  
> forbs.com

The key features of the site will allow employees and employers to create a type of informal "contract" each day of tasks that need to be completed. This will allow employees to feel the freedom of working from home while providing the employer with reasonable assurance of the employee's work.

## Technologies
**Authentication:** Users will log in and their name will be displayed on the main page.  
**Database data:** Lists of tasks for each day will be stored in a database.  
**WebSocket data:** Real time messages recived from employer about the employees tasks.  
**Service:** A service to download tasks to a web calendar will be provided for cross-platform use.  

### Technologies List
- HTML - Website structure
- CSS - Hot, chic, edgy style and design
- JavaScript - Calendar on web that you can add tasks to.
- Service - Calendar web service to download tasks to calendar.
- Database/Login - Employee will log in.
- WebSocket - Messages from employer
- React - Web framework

## Deliverables
**HTML:** Added html pages for the user login, the schedule page that contains most of the site's 
functionality, and the site about information. *Note I have already started doing the css assignment so my site may 
look like some css is already done.
